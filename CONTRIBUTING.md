# How to Contribute

## Getting help

To ask questions about the XBee Java Library go to the 
[Digi Forum](http://www.digi.com/support/forum).


## Reporting a bug

The way to report bugs is to use the 
[GitHub issue tracker](http://github.com/digidotcom/xbee-java/issues).
Before reporting a bug, please read the following points:

1. Make sure that is really a bug by checking the 
[documentation](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001438) and consulting the 
[FAQs](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001438/#reference/r_xb_java_lib_faq.htm) 
section.
2. If you still think you have found a bug, make sure someone has not already
reported it. See the list of 
[known issues](http://github.com/digidotcom/xbee-java/issues).
3. If it has not been reported yet, create a new issue. Make sure to add enough 
detail so that the bug can be reproduced.

**Note**: The issue tracker is for bugs, not requests for help. Questions 
should be asked on the [Digi Forum](http://www.digi.com/support/forum) instead.


## Suggesting a new feature

1. Consult the [FAQs](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001438/#reference/r_xb_java_lib_faq.htm) 
section to ensure that the behavior you would like is not excluded.
2. Make sure someone has not already requested it. See the list of 
[known issues](http://github.com/digidotcom/xbee-java/issues).
3. Submit your request in the issue tracker.


## Contributing code

1. Fork the [XBee Java Library](http://github.com/digidotcom/xbee-java) 
repository ([how to fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)).
2. Create a branch for your contribution. Use a name that defines the purpose of the additions/modifications. 
3. Make your changes following the code style used in the library.
4. Add the corresponding unit tests for the new code.
5. Make sure all tests pass.
6. Submit a pull request ([how to create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#next-steps)).
A project developer will review your work and then merge your request into the
project, or come back to you with comments and/or questions.
