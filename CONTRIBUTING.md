How to Contribute
=================

Getting help
------------
Questions and discussions about the XBee Java Library can be done on the
[Digi Forum](http://www.digi.com/support/forum).


Reporting a bug
---------------
The way to report bugs is to use the 
[GitHub issue tracker](http://github.com/digidotcom/XBeeJavaLibrary/issues).
Before reporting a bug, please read the following points:

1. Make sure that is really a bug by checking the 
[documentation](http://confluence.digi.com/display/XBJLIB) and consulting the 
[FAQs](https://confluence.digi.com/display/XBJLIB/Frequently+Asked+Questions+%28FAQs%29) 
section.
2. If you still think you have found a bug, make sure someone has not already
reported it. See the list of 
[known issues](http://github.com/digidotcom/XBeeJavaLibrary/issues).
3. If it has not been reported yet, create a new issue. Make sure to add enough 
detail so that the bug can be reproduced.

**Note**: The issue tracker is for bugs, not requests for help. Questions 
should be asked on the [Digi Forum](http://www.digi.com/support/forum) instead.


Suggesting a new feature
------------------------
1. Consult the [FAQs](https://confluence.digi.com/display/XBJLIB/Frequently+Asked+Questions+%28FAQs%29) 
section to ensure that the behavior you would like is not excluded.
2. Make sure someone has not already requested it. See the list of 
[known issues](http://github.com/digidotcom/XBeeJavaLibrary/issues).
3. Submit your request in the issue tracker.
