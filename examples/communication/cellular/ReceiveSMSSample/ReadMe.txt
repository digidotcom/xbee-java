  Introduction
  ------------
  This sample Java application shows how SMS messages are received by a 
  Cellular device using a callback executed every time a new SMS is received.
  
  The application prints the phone that sent the message and the text of the 
  SMS itself.
  
  NOTE: This example uses the Cellular device (CellularDevice) class as it is 
        the only device able to receive SMS messages.


  Files
  -----
    * com.digi.xbee.api.receivesms.MainApp.java:
      Main application class. It instantiates a Cellular device, establishes 
      a serial connection with it and waits for incoming SMS messages.
      
    * com.digi.xbee.api.receivesms.MySMSReceiveListener:
      Class that handles the received SMS messages.


  Requirements
  ------------
  To run this example you will need:
  
    * One Cellular radio with a micro SIM card inserted and its corresponding 
      carrier board (XBIB or equivalent). The Cellular module must be working 
      in API mode and connected to the Internet.
    * The XCTU application (available at www.digi.com/xctu).
    * A mobile phone to send the SMS message.


  Example setup
  -------------
    1) Plug the Cellular radio into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
       computer's USB or serial ports.
       
    2) Ensure that the module is in API mode and connected to the Internet 
       (associated to the cellular network). For further information on how to 
       perform this task, read the 'Configuring Your XBee Modules' topic of 
       the Getting Started guide.
       
    3) Set the port and baud rate of the receiver Cellular radio in the MainApp 
       class.
       If you configured the module in the previous step with XCTU, you will 
       see the port number and baud rate in the 'Port' label of the device 
       on the left view.


  Running the example
  -------------------
  First, build and launch the application. Then, you need to send an SMS 
  message from a mobile phone or from other Cellular device.
  
  When the SMS is sent, verify that the Cellular device has received it. The 
  application prints out in the console of the launched application the 
  following line:
       
    "Received SMS from XXXXXXXXXX >> '<TEXT>'"
    
   - Where XXXXXXXXXX is the phone number that send the SMS and <TEXT> is the 
     text contained in the SMS message.
