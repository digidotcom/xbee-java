 XBee Java Library v1.1.0, May 2015
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Changes with respect to previous version:
     * Added support for explicit frames and application layer fields 
       (Source endpoint, Destination endpoint, Profile ID, and Cluster ID).
     * Added five examples that demonstrate the new functionality of the API:

         Transparent (AT) operating mode is not supported by the library.
       * Management of local (attached to the PC) and remote XBee device 
         objects.
       * Discovery of remote XBee devices that are associated to the same 
         network as the local one.
       * Configuration of local and remote XBee devices:
         * Configure common parameters with specific setters and getters.
         * Configure any other parameter with generic methods.
         * Execute AT commands.
         * Apply configuration changes.
         * Write configuration changes.
         * Reset the device.
       * Transmission of data to all the XBee devices of the network or to a 
         specific one.
       * Reception of data from remote XBee devices:
         * Data polling.
         * Data reception callback.
       * Reception of network status changes related to the local XBee device.
       * IO lines management:
         * Configure IO lines
         * Set IO line value.
         * Read IO line value.
         * Receive IO data samples from any remote XBee device of the network.
     
     * Set of examples demonstrating the functionality of the API.
       * Communication:
